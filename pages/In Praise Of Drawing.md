# In Praise Of Drawing Series 1

**~ Episode 1 ~**

##Drawing Connectes Us With Our Highest Creative Self

Drawing has a meditative quality. It has the ability to put us into a state mind where you can access your highest creative function, your muse. 

As the pencil floats across the page, the line traces the dance steps between your muse and the everyday here and now you. When you surrender the light comes flooding in and for a moment we are good like. The line appeats effortlessly on the page. The drawing has become flow, the way. It has become the Tao and the drawer has become wu-wei.
